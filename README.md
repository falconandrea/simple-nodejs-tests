# NodeJs Tests

Some simple exercises for test knowledges learned during the NodeJs courses that I'm following.

## [List Films](https://github.com/falconandrea/simple-nodejs-tests/tree/main/list-films)

Using:

- Moongose/MongoDB for save a list of films (title and year)
- Express for routing
- EJS templating and TailwindCSS for create the table list for show all films in DB, and a simple popup with a form for add new films
- Using Prettier and Eslint
- Test code with Jest.
